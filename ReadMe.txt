- A simple MAC (Multiply and Accumulate) System has been realised using Verilog.
- It takes 2 8-bit inputs, multiplies them and accumulates them in an accumulating register.
- version 1 is the most basic one, whereas version 2 (under working) has much more features which enables user to have more control over the system.
